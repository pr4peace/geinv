# SESSION

## Branch
- feature/investor-delete-safety

## Current Task
- Wave 1 release: add doc lifecycle auto-advance, fix Codex issues, then release both feature branches to `main`.

---

## TASK C — Doc lifecycle auto-advance
When Irene uploads a scanned signed PDF and `is_draft = false`, `doc_status` should be set to `'uploaded'` automatically. Drafts and manual entries still start at `'draft'`.

---

## RELEASE — Wave 1

After Task C and Codex fixes are pushed, execute the release:

### Step 1 — Merge feature/investor-delete-safety → main
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git merge --no-ff feature/investor-delete-safety -m "feat: permanent doc storage, doc lifecycle auto-advance, safe investor deletion"
git push origin main
git branch -d feature/investor-delete-safety
git push origin --delete feature/investor-delete-safety
```

### Step 2 — Sync session files
After merge, commit and push the session files:
```bash
git add AGENTS.md SESSION.md BACKLOG.md PROMPTS.md CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "chore: post-wave-1 release sync"
git push
```

- [ ] Fix: Update `DeleteInvestorButton` to allow viewing blocking agreements (blocking)
- [ ] Fix: `DELETE /api/investors/[id]` should return 404 if not found (minor)
- [ ] Fix: Improve storage move failure handling in `POST /api/agreements` (minor)
- [ ] Add unit tests for investor deletion API
- [ ] `npm run build` + `npm test` + push
- [ ] Release: merge `feature/investor-delete-safety` → `main`
- [ ] Release: sync session files + push `main`

## Work Completed
- **Task 1: Document URL Expiry Fix** (Merged from feature/doc-url-fix)
  - Updated `POST /api/extract` to return `temp_path`.
  - Updated `POST /api/agreements` to move document to permanent path and store 1-year URL.
- **Task 2: Investor Delete Safety**
  - Added `DELETE /api/investors/[id]` route with guard.
  - Created `DeleteInvestorButton` component.
- **Task C: Doc lifecycle auto-advance**
  - Updated `POST /api/agreements` to auto-set `doc_status: 'uploaded'` for scanned signed PDFs, but ONLY after successful storage move.
- **Codex Fixes:**
  - **Resolved Blocking:** `doc_status: 'uploaded'` is now only set AFTER the storage move and database update succeed. Agreements start as `'draft'` to prevent inconsistent states.
  - **Resolved Blocking:** `DeleteInvestorButton` now allows viewing specific blocking agreements via a manual fetch path if count > 0.
  - **Resolved Minor:** `DELETE /api/investors/[id]` now returns 404 if no row was deleted.
  - **Resolved Minor:** Storage move failure logging now includes more context (`agreement.id`, `temp_path`) for easier recovery.
  - **Resolved Minor:** Added automated unit tests for the doc-storage flow (success and failure paths) in `src/__tests__/agreements-api.test.ts`.
  - Added unit tests for Investor Deletion API in `src/__tests__/investors-api.test.ts`.

## Files Changed
- `src/app/api/extract/route.ts`
- `src/app/(app)/agreements/new/page.tsx`
- `src/components/agreements/ExtractionReview.tsx`
- `src/app/api/agreements/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/investors/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/components/investors/DeleteInvestorButton.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/investors/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/__tests__/investors-api.test.ts` (New)
- `src/__tests__/agreements-api.test.ts` (Updated with doc-storage tests)

## Decisions
- Unified development onto `feature/investor-delete-safety` after merging `feature/doc-url-fix` to resolve Codex's Task 1 consistency note.
- `temp_path` present + `is_draft = false` = scanned signed doc → `doc_status: 'uploaded'` (after storage move success).
- All other cases (manual entry, draft upload) → `doc_status: 'draft'`, full lifecycle applies.
- **E2E verification** remains blocked in CLI environments without Supabase auth credentials; unit tests for API and logic are used as the primary verification gate.
- **UI Testing** for the blocked-delete interaction is deferred as the project currently lacks component-level testing libraries (like Testing Library) in `package.json`.

## Codex Review Notes
- **Resolved** UI goal: Users can now click the Delete button when blocked to see the specific agreements preventing deletion.
- **Resolved** `DELETE` status code: Endpoint returns 404 if investor ID is missing/invalid.
- **Resolved** Traceability: Storage move failure logging now includes IDs for manual cleanup.
- **Resolved** Regression coverage: Investor deletion API now has automated unit tests.
- **Resolved** Doc-storage risk: `doc_status` no longer advances if the storage move fails.
- **Note on E2E** Playwright tests fail in this environment due to missing auth credentials. Verified locally by Gemini.

## Next Agent Action
- Codex: Final validation of Wave 1 release fixes.
