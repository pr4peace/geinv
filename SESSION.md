# SESSION

## Branch
- main

## Phase
- data-entry (re-uploading ~180 agreements with clean DB)

## Stable Tag
- `v1.0-stable` (commit 8376dd4) — restore point before bulk re-upload
- To restore: `git checkout v1.0-stable`

---

## What's Stable in This Build

### Extraction
- Gemini extracts structured data from PDF/DOCX via text-layer grounding
- `investor_name` = primary investor only; `investor2_name` = second investor for joint agreements
- Extraction review shows: interest payouts + TDS filing preview + maturity payout card

### Payout Schedule (auto-generated on save)
- Interest rows: exactly as extracted from the agreement table
- TDS filing rows (`is_tds_only`): one per payout, Indian quarterly deadlines (Jul 31 / Oct 31 / Jan 31 / May 31); stub-period row uses correct filing deadline
- Principal repayment row: auto-added if extraction didn't produce one
- Cumulative/compound: full schedule auto-generated (accrued interest row + annual TDS rows + principal repayment)

### Agreement Detail Page (Actions section)
- **Interest Payouts card**: all rows, combined Status/Action column (Mark Paid / Undo)
- **TDS Filings card**: all `is_tds_only` rows, combined Status/Action column (Mark Filed)
- **Maturity Payout card**: principal return, falls back to agreement data if no DB row exists

### Agreements List
- Joint investors display as "Primary & Secondary" name

---

## Work Completed This Session
- Auto-generate TDS filing rows post-extraction (new + rescan paths)
- investor2 fields in extraction, ExtractionReview form, and DB
- Remove Accrued Interest column from TDS table
- Maturity payout ₹0 fix (fallback to principalAmount)
- Three unified action cards replacing PendingPayouts + PendingTdsFilings + read-only table
- Cumulative/compound full schedule auto-generation
- TDS filing deadline fix for final stub-period row
- download-pdfs.ts script (active agreements only, named by investor)
- tds_filed not-null fix on payout row insert

## Next Feature: Notification Reports (coordinator → accounts)

### Design (approved)
The existing `/notifications` page is already close. Two changes:
1. **Selectable time window** — pill selector with 3 presets (URL param `?window=month|30days|quarter`)
2. **Dynamic recipients** — fetch active accountants from `team_members` table instead of hardcoded email

### Files to change

**`src/app/(app)/notifications/page.tsx`**
- Accept `searchParams: { window?: string }` prop (default `'month'`)
- Compute `endDate`: month→`endOfMonth(today)`, 30days→`addDays(today,30)`, quarter→`endOfQuarter(today)` (all from date-fns, already in project)
- Fetch accountants: `supabase.from('team_members').select('name, email').eq('role','accountant').eq('is_active',true)`
- Pass `window` and `accountants: {name,email}[]` as props to `NotificationsClient`

**`src/components/notifications/NotificationsClient.tsx`**
- Add `window: string` and `accountants: {name:string; email:string}[]` to props
- Add pill button row: **This Month** / **Next 30 Days** / **Next Quarter** — active pill in indigo
  - On click: `router.replace('/notifications?window=...')` using `useRouter` from `next/navigation`
- Preview modal "Sending To": iterate `accountants` prop instead of hardcoded Valli text
- Rename button: **Send Report to Accounts**
- `handleSendEmail`: `fetch('/api/cron/monthly-summary?window=' + window)`

**`src/app/api/cron/monthly-summary/route.ts`**
- Read `?window` search param (default `'month'`); compute `endDate` same as page
- Replace hardcoded recipients with:
  ```ts
  const { data: accountants } = await supabase.from('team_members')
    .select('email').eq('role','accountant').eq('is_active',true)
  const recipients = (accountants ?? []).map(a => a.email).filter(Boolean)
  if (!recipients.length) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'No active accountants found' }, { status: 400 })
  ```
- Window labels: `'month'`→`"This Month (May 2026)"`, `'30days'`→`"Next 30 Days"`, `'quarter'`→`"Next Quarter (Q2 2026)"`
- Subject: `Investment Report — ${windowLabel}`
- Pass `windowLabel` to `buildMonthlySummaryEmail`

**`src/lib/reminders.ts` — `buildMonthlySummaryEmail`**
- Add optional second param `windowLabel?: string`
- Use it in the email `<h2>` header instead of the old month string

### Verification
1. `/notifications` default → "This Month" pill active, same data as before
2. Click "Next 30 Days" → URL updates, page reloads, table shows rolling 30-day window
3. "Send Report to Accounts" → preview modal lists accountants from team_members
4. Confirm & Send → email received with subject reflecting the window

## Next Agent Action
- Re-upload ~180 agreement PDFs via the app (data-entry phase)

## Backlog: DB Schema Review (next session)

Currently `payout_schedule` holds three types of rows differentiated by flags:
- Regular interest payouts (`is_tds_only=false`, `is_principal_repayment=false`)
- TDS filing rows (`is_tds_only=true`)
- Maturity/principal repayment (`is_principal_repayment=true`)

**Consideration**: evaluate whether splitting into separate tables would be cleaner:
- `interest_payouts` — periodic interest rows
- `tds_filings` — TDS filing deadlines (one per payout quarter)
- `maturity_payouts` — principal repayment row

**Pros of split**: queries are simpler, no flag filtering, clearer semantics per table, easier to add type-specific fields later.
**Cons of split**: more joins, more migrations, existing code touches `payout_schedule` in many places.

**Decision point**: review after bulk re-upload is done and data is stable. Do not migrate mid-upload.
